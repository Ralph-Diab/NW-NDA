Getting Started:

To participate in the developement of NW-NDA, and in the course/development work of it, we'll do as much as possible via the git repo github.com/CommonAccord/NW-NDA.

**Get a GitHub account**
**Install VS Code and its plugin**
**Clone NW-NDA to your GitHub account**
**Clone your version of NW-NDA into your VS Code app**

To participate fully, you will need to install the app Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/download

Download and install VS Code.  (Tell us if you have any problems.)

Then (please fill this in with your experience) https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github

Then download github.com/CommonAccord/NW-NDA.
(Should we use the github flow of each person cloning into their own account, then downloading from that version?  Yes?)

(I originally encountered a problem (on a new MacMini) of there not being git infrastructure on my machine.  I needed to install Xcode.  Not sure if this was necessary or a confusion.)

Open the repo in VS Code.  Try making a change to a file, save it.  Click on the little "graph" (circles connected by lines) icon.  Add the modified file to the commit list (click on the + sign to move it into the commit pack, then write a short message, and commit.)

Do a pull-request.
(Need to work through the pull-request cycle - since others will not have authority to directly commit.)

**To be able to render your work locally, you will need a local webserver running Cmacc-Org or similar**
*** If "VS Code does not identify Git in the user's path" : The issue is either that the user has not given VS Code the “permission” to access all the computer’s files (therefore VS Code was not able to find Git), or that the user needs to manually overwrite the “git.path” setting to point to their program files directory (see the many answers at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26620312/git-installing-git-in-path-with-github-client-for-windows). However, generally, when you install the Github extension to VS Code, there is no problem whatsoever ***
